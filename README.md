# Gendered networks amongst German researchers

## tl;dr 
A visualization of gendered networks amongst researchers funded by the DFG in order to explore collaboration and gender equality within academia.

## Project description
As one of the largest German instutition to fund research is [commited to gender equality](https://www.dfg.de/en/service/press/press_releases/2017/press_release_no_24/index.html "Press Release No. 24 | 5 July 2017"), it makes sense to look at their own data in order to analyze how and where measures need to be taken to own up to these promises. We're using parts of the GEPRIS data to look at networks within research project that are funded by the DFG. As [research](https://www.equityinstem.org/networks-metaanalysis/) shows, people tend to form networks with people who are similar to them, which can hinder gender inclusion in fields that have traditionally been shaped by male networks. To find out whether this is the case for German academia and research as well, we are visualizing the networks amongst researchers funded by DFG.

### Target audience
The target audience for this project are equal opportunity commissioners at universities and people interested in gender equality. It should give you an opportunity to explore different universities' degrees of gender equality to see where there's still work to be done.
(The description of the project should not be too extensive but help people understand the project and your design decisions in detail. Describe the idea behind the visualization project, the target group, and what its functionality is (e.g., interaction). Please complete this description with said design decisions as stated above. Do not forget to describe external data sources you used, and mention libraries you used in addition to d3.js.)

## Installation

## Manual
(A brief manual about how to use the software. For this it makes sense to use screencasts or screenshots.)
